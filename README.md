It is a GUI based Handwritten digit recognition system using CNN model. MNIST dataset is used to train and test the model. 
Some of the important terms used are-
The Sequential class allows you to create models layer by layer in a step-by-step fashion, where each layer flows sequentially from the previous one.

Conv2D: This layer creates a convolutional layer for 2D input. Convolutional layers are fundamental building blocks in CNNs and are used to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. The layer's parameters include the number of filters (or kernels), the size of the filters, the activation function, and more.

MaxPool2D: This layer performs max pooling operation for spatial data (2D). It is used to down-sample the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing the computation in the network and providing a form of translation invariance.

Flatten: This layer is used to flatten the input, effectively transforming it into a 1D array. It's often used to transition from convolutional/pooling layers to fully connected layers.

Dense: This layer represents a fully connected layer, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. It's commonly used in the final layers of a neural network.

Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. During training, randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" by setting their weights to zero, which helps the network generalize better to unseen data.

The convolutional layer (Conv2D) applies filters to the input image, extracting features such as edges, corners, and textures. The activation function (ReLU) introduces non-linearity.
The max-pooling layer (MaxPool2D) downsamples the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, reducing the number of parameters and providing some degree of translation invariance.
When you increase the number of filters in the convolutional layer (from 32 to 64 in this case), the network has the potential to capture more complex and abstract features.
